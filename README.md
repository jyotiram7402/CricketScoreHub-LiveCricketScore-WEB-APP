# CricketScoreHub-LiveCricketScore-WEB-APP
CricketScoreHub is a dynamic and feature-rich web application that brings the exciting world of live cricket scores to enthusiasts, powered by the robust combination of Spring Boot, Angular 17, and MySQL as the database. This trinity of technologies ensures a seamless and efficient experience for users seeking real-time updates on cricket matches.

Key Components:

1.Spring Boot Backend:

CricketScoreHub's backend is built on Spring Boot, a Java-based framework known for its simplicity and productivity. Spring Boot facilitates rapid development by providing a convention-over-configuration approach, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than dealing with boilerplate code.

2.Angular 17 Frontend:

The frontend of CricketScoreHub leverages Angular 17, a powerful and widely-used JavaScript framework. Angular 17 provides a modular and component-based architecture, allowing for the creation of a dynamic and responsive user interface. The use of Angular ensures a seamless and interactive experience for users as they navigate through live scores and match details.

3.MySQL Database:

CricketScoreHub relies on MySQL as its database management system, ensuring a robust and scalable data storage solution. MySQL is known for its reliability, performance, and ease of integration, making it an ideal choice for managing the application's data, including match details, player statistics, and user profiles.
